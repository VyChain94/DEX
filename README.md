  A Token Swap Dapp utilizing the 0x API that requires user's to connect to their MetaMask account
and aggregate liquidity across the greater DEX ecosystem and surfacee the best price to the user.
</p>

<h2> 
  I created this project to allow users to connect to the Web3 DEFI ecosystem without having to create accounts or log in to sites like coinbase, kraken, binance, etc.
<h2>

<h3>
  The original project and it's features are complete except for the conversion of the trading gas fees that need to be presented in USD, instead of the native ETH gas fee of gwei.<br> 
A few features that I will be impletenting in the future, are abilities to distribute NFT's and native token's that can be used to facilitate the ultimate goal of this project
which is to allow communities and their members to be in direct control of its financial growth and be rewarded by their local participation via utility-based digital assets that are kept track of on the blockchain.
</h3>

<h3>
  To use the Token swap app feature, You simply just need to click on the Launch App button on any of the pages. Which will lead you to the app, once you are on the swap dapp click on the "Sign In With MetaMask" button. (If you don't have MetaMask extenstion on your browser you must first install it.) <br>
  The MetaMask button will then read "Connected" if you are correctly connected. <br>
  Now that you are connected, click on "swap from:" and choose the token you would like to swap from. Once decided, click on "swap to:" and choose the token you would like to swap to. <br>
  clicking out of the "swap from:" box will then generate the token conversion rate and gas fees that will be applied to your swap.
